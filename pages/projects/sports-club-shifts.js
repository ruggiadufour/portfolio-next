            Sports Club shifts
          </h1>

          <h2 className="is-size-3 subtitle color-text-2">Problem:</h2>
          <p className="is-size-4 subtitle color-text-3">
            It is summer in the province of Chaco - Argentina, and unluckly
            there is very hot, around 35-40Â°C, but luckly the San Bernardo city
            has a sports club with some pools. Then the city hall needed to open
            this sports club, but the pandemic situation is still around, so
            they need a way to solve that problem. They concluded that they need
            a system in which people who want to go to the club can register
            their shifts, then if a coronavirus wave come from there, they will
            be able to track the trail.
          </p>

          <h2 className="is-size-3 subtitle color-text-2">Solution:</h2>
          <p className="is-size-4 subtitle color-text-3">
            The main requirement was every person could access to the system
            from everywhere to do their shifts, so the system had to be a
            web-site.
            <br />
            We decided to develop with React.js, Material-UI for front-end and
            Strapi for back-end.
          </p>

          <h2 className="is-size-3 subtitle color-text-2">Result:</h2>
          <p className="is-size-4 subtitle color-text-3">
            After some days of development, the site was finished.
          </p>
